This is a escape-room type game, have fun!

I'm learning new codes to help me improve my coding, that's why I thinked in doing a escape-room type game.

To see the code of it, you'll have to use Gamemaker Studio 2.

If you have any suggestion or any thing that you think would be cool in it, please tell me :D
